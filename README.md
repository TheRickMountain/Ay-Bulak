# Ay Bulak

**Ay Bulak** is an upcoming **farming and village life simulation game** where you start a new life on a quiet forest glade, building a village from scratch.

The game is currently in **early development** and is being built from scratch using a custom 2D engine written in **C# + MonoGame**.

## Concept

You arrive in the wilderness as part of a rural colonization program. Starting with just a small plot of land, your goal is to build a thriving village, live off the land, care for animals, form relationships with settlers, and experience peaceful, immersive village life.

## Planned Features

- **Farming** — grow crops, manage fields, and use greenhouses
- **Animal husbandry** — raise chickens, cows, and other animals
- **Fishing & bug catching** — gather food and unique resources
- **Crafting** — create tools, furniture, and village decorations
- **Village building** — construct houses, barns, saunas, chicken coops, and more
- **Settlement simulation**:
  - Each settler will have their own **home and personal plot**
  - Settlers will carry out daily routines: farming, crafting, relaxing, fulfilling their needs
- **Seasons, weather, and time system** — with a dynamic day/night and seasonal cycle
- **Relationship system** — talk to villagers, give gifts, build friendships, invite them over, and ask for help
- Storyline, secrets and more

## Engine

The game is being developed on a **new custom 2D engine**, built entirely in **C# with MonoGame**.

> This engine is a significant upgrade from the one used in my previous game [Paleon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1554220/Paleon/). It incorporates all the lessons learned, better architecture, and more robust rendering and simulation systems.

## Development Status

Ay Bulak is currently in a **alpha phase**. No Steam page is available yet.

I’m focused on building core mechanics, engine systems, and design foundations before moving into content production and visuals.
